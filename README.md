# 🎮 Nemunai - A PSX Horror Survival Experience

**Nemunai** is a retro-styled psychological horror game developed in Unity, heavily inspired by classic PSX-era titles and survival horror staples. It mixes traditional survival gameplay with combat mechanics, enveloped in a disturbing atmosphere inspired by the cursed spiral motifs of *Uzumaki* by Junji Ito.

## 🌀 Story

In *Nemunai*, you step into the shoes of a lone protagonist stranded in a decaying town haunted by spirals — shapes that should be harmless, yet seem to corrupt and consume everything around them. Inspired by the mind-bending horror of *Uzumaki*, this game is not a direct adaptation but rather an atmospheric homage.

You will uncover cryptic journals, decode visual clues, and survive grotesque enemies as the town and its spiral curse slowly erode your sanity. Reality is fragile, and the spirals are watching...

## 🕹 Gameplay

Nemunai blends **survival horror** mechanics with **low-poly combat**, offering a mix of exploration, and puzzle-solving.

- 🧠 Puzzle-solving based on symbols and spatial awareness  
- 🗡 Retro-style combat with melee and limited firearms  

---

## 🎨 Visual Style

The game recreates the nostalgic aesthetics of PlayStation 1 horror games using custom shaders and post-processing effects:

- Pixelated textures and dithering  
- Interlaced screen effects and fake CRT distortion   
- Atmospheric lighting emulating hardware limitations  

All of this contributes to a disturbing, claustrophobic, and immersive horror experience.
