      It''s been a while since I''ve written letters
      to you. I guess after everything that happened, the last thing you expected
      was to hear from me... let alone like this. I don''t know how to start this
      without sounding crazy, so I''ll get straight to the point: I need you to come
      to Nemunai.

      I know what you''re thinking. This place... I don''t know,
      everything''s been weird. Help me get out of town, I need to move and get out
      of here.

      I''m not going to lie to you, there''s something strange going
      on here. I couldn''t explain it if I tried. Not in words that make sense. I
      just know something will happen.

      I wouldn''t ask you this if it wasn''t
      important. If it wasn''t urgent. If I wasn''t myself...

      Come only if
      you still trust me. Come if you still remember what we promised that night
      in the firefly field.

      Come... and don''t tell anyone you''re coming.

      I''ll
      be waiting for you.



      Reiko.'

      A current in which the dimensions of time intertwine,

      mind
      and flesh. It was said that those who sought first to invoke, to enter the
      soul of the people, plunged into an endless abyss.



      The spirals not
      only distort reality, but devour perception, dragging the unwary into a place
      where beginning and end merge in an eternal cycle.



      Only those who
      can see beyond the spiral, who dare to look into the centre of the second face,
      can unleash what lies dormant in the bowels of Nemunai.'

      The
      only way to unlock the true form of the people is to embrace the third vortex
      of the mind, recognising the pattern hidden in the spiral.



      But beware,
      for those who gaze too long may be trapped, their souls fractured between dimensions.



      Only
      those who speak the right words, those capable of fearlessly invoking the face
      of the vortex, can unleash the final awakening of Nemunai.'
